# vulkan-triangle

This is a little side project to see what I can do with Vulkan.

## Compiling

To compile, you will need:
- The [tup build](https://gittup.org/tup/) system.
- [glslangValidator](https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/ogl/trunk/ecosystem/public/sdk/tools/glslang/Install/)
- A recent version of GCC.
- GLFW3
- Vulkan headers

Just run `tup` to build it.

Obviously you will need graphics drivers and a graphics card which support the Vulkan API.
